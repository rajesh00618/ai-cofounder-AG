### Goal Input
- Type your biggest startup goal (e.g. "Earn $1000 in 30 days")
- Click **"Analyze"**

### Clarifying Questions

- Answer each (single-select or type your own)
- After all answered → AI runs **Reality Engine**

### Reality Engine Results
- Overall **Reality Score** (0–100%)
- Radar chart across 8 dimensions
- Risk list + AI recommendation
- If score ≥ 50 → click **"Generate Blueprint"**

### Generation

- Scores generated (business health, startup score)
- Full execution plan created with multiple phases/sprints covering the entire journey to the goal

- First sprint is active — its tasks appear as **Today's Tasks**

### Blueprint Review (`/business-planning`)
